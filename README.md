# Cognitrek
Main repository for NGI Search Project COGNITREK

## Overview
COGNITREK is an innovative initiative designed to empower individuals to understand complex documents through a conversational interface. By enhancing cognitive accessibility, COGNITREK transcends classic web accessibility, breaking down barriers to understanding and fostering a more inclusive digital experience.

### Key Objectives
1. **Cognitive Accessibility**:
   - Making complex information accessible and understandable for all users.

2. **Decoupling Information**:
   - Structuring content to cater to individual cognitive needs.

3. **Providing Context**:
   - Enabling users to grasp nuanced meanings and interrelations within content.

4. **AI-Based Conversation and Dialogue**:
   - Leveraging conversational AI to deliver personalized and interactive user experiences.



## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to the deliverables for each project milestone, where the architecture, components, and other details are outlined. 

The `software` folders contains all the developed code, organized into three main subdirectories:

1. **Backend**: This directory includes the server-side components, APIs, and other services related to the application's core functionality.
2. **Converters**: Here, you will find the scripts and utilities responsible for transforming or processing data in various formats, ensuring compatibility and smooth integration across the system. It is located in the backend folder.
3. **Frontend**: This folder contains the user interface code, including the web or app-based components that interact with the backend and provide the user experience.

The XDAM (back-end and front-end) and XDIR (back-end and front-end) repositories are key components utilized by Cognitrek, having been driven forward by this project.

Adapt the following HTML content to make it more accessible for a person with severe ADHD. Apply the following adjustments:
	1.	Highly Simplified Content:
        •	Use minimal, direct sentences and remove any superfluous details.
        •	Clearly state only the essential points, avoiding abstract or overly technical terms.
        •	Highlight critical words or concepts to immediately capture attention.
	2.	Clear and Segmented Structure:
        •	Divide the content into very short sections with bold headings or subheadings.
        •	Transform almost every multi-sentence block into bullet points or numbered steps.
        •	Start each section with a clear statement of purpose or conclusion.
	3.	Strong Visual Guidance:
        •	Emphasize key relationships using words like “because,” “as a result,” or “due to,” to make logical connections explicit.
        •	Provide simple, direct captions for images, charts, or any visual elements.
        •	Incorporate extra white space or clear separators between topics to minimize distraction.
	4.	Output Requirements:
        •	The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.
        •	Provide a JSON array with objects containing the following details for each modification:
        •	id: The ID of the modified element.
        •	original_text: The original text before modification.
        •	start_position_modification: The start index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	end_position_modification: The end index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	modified_text: The updated text after applying the adjustments.
        •	modification: A brief description of the change (e.g., “reduced sentence length,” “converted paragraph to bullet points,” “highlighted key concept,” etc.).

Input JSON:

Output Format Example:

[
  {
    "id": "unique_element_id",
    "original_text": "original text here",
    "start_position_modification": "start position in content string",
    "end_position_modification": "end position in content string",
    "modified_text": "modified text here",

  }

Please ensure:
	1.	The JSON contains only the modified blocks or subblocks.

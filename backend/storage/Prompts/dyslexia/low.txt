Adapt the following JSON content representing a text structure to make it accessible for a person with mild dyslexia. Apply the following adjustments:
	1. Content Simplification:
		* Break long sentences into shorter, simpler sentences while maintaining the meaning.
		* Highlight key words or important terms in bold within the content.
	2. Structure Enhancements:
		* Organize lists with bullet points or numbers where applicable.
		* Ensure each section starts with a clear and concise main idea.
	3. Output Requirements:
		* The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.
		* Provide a JSON object with the following details for each modification:
		* The id of the modified element.
		* The original_text.
		* The start_position_modification and end_position_modification within the content string of the tag element.
		* The modified_text.
		* The modification (description of the change, e.g., bolded, simplified, etc.).

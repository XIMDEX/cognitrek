Adapt the following HTML content to make it accessible for a person with moderate dyslexia. Apply the following adjustments:
  1.	Content Simplification:
    * Simplify sentences further, using concrete language and breaking down complex ideas into smaller, manageable parts.
    * Replace technical or abstract terms with simpler language or include a brief explanation next to them.
    * Highlight key terms or phrases in bold.
  2.	Structural Enhancements:
    * Reorganize content into shorter paragraphs with clear headings for each section.
    * Use bullet points or numbered lists for information that can be itemized.
    * Begin each section with a clear and concise statement summarizing its content.
  3.	Visualization Improvements:
    * Explicitly show relationships between ideas using words like “because,” “due to,” or “as a result.”
    * Incorporate short explanatory phrases for diagrams, images, or data referenced in the text.
  4.	Output Requirements:
		* The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.
		* Provide a JSON object with the following details for each modification:
		* The id of the modified element.
		* The original_text.
		* The start_position_modification and end_position_modification within the content string of the tag element.
		* The modified_text.
		* The modification (description of the change, e.g., bolded, simplified, etc.).


Input JSON:

Output Format:

[
    {
        "id": "unique_element_id",
        "original_text": "original text here",
        "start_position_modification": "start position in content string",
        "end_position_modification": "end position in content string",
        "modified_text": "modified text here",
        "modification": "description of the change"
    },
    ...

Ensure that:
	1. The output JSON contains only the modified blocks or subblocks.
	2. All modifications are precisely mapped with accurate positions and descriptions.

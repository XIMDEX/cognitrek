Adapt the following HTML content to make it accessible for a person with severe dyslexia. Apply the following adjustments:
	1.	Content Simplification:
		* Reduce text complexity to the minimum by using short, simple sentences.
		* Replace abstract or technical terms with tangible, everyday language, or provide a direct, brief explanation.
		* Highlight key terms or phrases in bold.
	2.	Structural Enhancements:
		* Organize the content into very short paragraphs with one idea per paragraph.
		* Use clear headings for every section and subsection.
		* Present complex information using bullet points, numbered lists, or tables where applicable.
		* Ensure each section begins with an easily understandable summary.
	3.	Visualization and Accessibility:
		* Prioritize visuals, such as diagrams or images, to replace or complement text when possible.
		* Add brief, explanatory text for visuals to ensure clarity.
		* Explicitly connect ideas using simple language, with phrases like “this means,” “because,” or “as a result.”
	4.	Output Requirements:
		* The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.
		* Provide a JSON object with the following details for each modification:
		* The id of the modified element.
		* The original_text.
		* The start_position_modification and end_position_modification within the content string of the tag element.
		* The modified_text.
		* The modification (description of the change, e.g., bolded, simplified, etc.).

Input JSON:

Output Format:

[
    {
        "id": "unique_element_id",
        "original_text": "original text here",
        "start_position_modification": "start position in content string",
        "end_position_modification": "end position in content string",
        "modified_text": "modified text here",
        "modification": "description of the change"
    },
    ...

Ensure that:
	1. The output JSON contains only the modified blocks or subblocks.
	2. All modifications are precisely mapped with accurate positions and descriptions.

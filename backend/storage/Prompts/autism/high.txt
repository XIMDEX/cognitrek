Adapt the following HTML content to make it more accessible for a person with severe support needs on the autism spectrum. Apply the following adjustments:
	1.	Highly Simplified and Literal Text:
        •	Eliminate figurative language or ambiguity; use literal, concrete phrases.
        •	Break paragraphs down to one to two short sentences, focusing on a single idea per line or bullet point.
        •	Limit vocabulary to the most essential words; clarify special or uncommon terms immediately.
	2.	Strictly Segmented Structure:
        •	Use clear, bold headings for each idea or topic.
        •	Transform almost every multi-sentence block into bullet points or very short lines of text.
        •	Start each section with a direct statement of its main point.
	3.	Explicit Visual and Contextual Clues:
        •	State how images, charts, or data relate to the main text (e.g., “This image shows X. It helps explain Y.”).
        •	Include transitional words to show connections or causes (“because,” “thus,” “as a result,” etc.).
        •	Provide ample white space or line breaks to visually separate different ideas.
	4.	Output Requirements:
        •	The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.
        •	Provide a JSON array with objects containing the following details for each modification:
        •	id: The ID of the modified element.
        •	original_text: The original text before modification.
        •	start_position_modification: The start index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	end_position_modification: The end index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	modified_text: The updated text after applying the adjustments.
        •	modification: A brief description of the change (e.g., “reduced sentence length,” “converted paragraph to bullet points,” etc.).

Input JSON:

###XIMDEX_CONTENT###

Output Format Example:

[
  {
    "id": "unique_element_id",
    "original_text": "original text here",
    "start_position_modification": "start position in content string",
    "end_position_modification": "end position in content string",
    "modified_text": "modified text here",
    "modification": "description of the change"
  }
]

Please ensure:
	1.	The JSON contains only the modified blocks or subblocks.
	2.	All modifications are accurately tracked with precise positions and clear descriptions.

Use the appropriate version (mild, moderate, or severe support needs) based on the specific requirements for individuals on the autism spectrum.

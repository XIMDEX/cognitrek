Adapt the following HTML content to make it more accessible for a person with mild support needs on the autism spectrum. Apply the following adjustments:
	1.	Content Clarity and Predictability:
        •	Use straightforward, literal language to avoid ambiguity.
        •	Maintain a consistent writing style, avoiding abrupt changes in tone or language.
        •	Clearly define any unfamiliar terms or abbreviations on first use.
	2.	Structured Layout:
        •	Organize sections with clear headings and subheadings to provide a predictable reading flow.
        •	Use short paragraphs, bullet points, or numbered lists to break down complex information.
        •	Provide introductory summaries for each section, briefly stating the key topic or objective.
	3.	Explicit Context and Transitions:
        •	Use transition words (e.g., “first,” “next,” “finally”) to indicate the sequence of information.
        •	Include brief explanations of why an idea is introduced or how it connects to other points.
        •	Offer literal, concise cues or labels for any images, diagrams, or special formatting.
	4.	Output Requirements:
        •	The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.

        •	id: The ID of the modified element.
        •	original_text: The original text before modification.
        •	start_position_modification: The start index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	end_position_modification: The end index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	modified_text: The updated text after applying the adjustments.

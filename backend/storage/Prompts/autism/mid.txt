Adapt the following HTML content to make it more accessible for a person with moderate support needs on the autism spectrum. Apply the following adjustments:
	1.	Simplified Content and Consistency:
        •	Use concise, direct language, avoiding idiomatic or metaphorical expressions.
        •	Break up longer sentences into smaller, more digestible statements.
        •	Provide clear definitions or brief explanations for any technical or less-common words.
	2.	Highly Organized Structure:
        •	Divide the content into well-labeled sections, each starting with a brief overview.
        •	Present critical details in bullet points or numbered steps to reduce complexity.
        •	Keep paragraphs very short (1–3 sentences) to help the reader process information in smaller chunks.
	3.	Clear Context and Visual Support:
        •	Explicitly explain the purpose of images, diagrams, or tables (e.g., “This chart shows X because…”).
        •	Use consistent headings and subheadings, so the user knows what to expect in each section.
        •	Consider using bold or italic text to highlight key points, but do so sparingly to avoid clutter.
	4.	Output Requirements:
        •	The output must only include the modified blocks or subblocks in the original JSON.
        •	Provide a JSON array with objects containing the following details for each modification:
        •	id: The ID of the modified element.
        •	original_text: The original text before modification.
        •	start_position_modification: The start index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	end_position_modification: The end index of the modification within the element’s content string.
        •	modified_text: The updated text after applying the adjustments.
        •	modification: A brief description of the change (e.g., “simplified terminology,” “added clear explanation,” etc.).
